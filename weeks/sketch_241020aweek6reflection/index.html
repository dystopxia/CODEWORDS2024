            <h1>Week 6</h1>
            <h3>Tuesday, 27th August</h3>
            
            <h2>Class Activities:</h2>
            <p>In this week’s lesson, we went over our first assignment submission for this course - brief 1 Paper prototypes, where we had to choose a short sentence of maximum 10 words. I chose a sentence from Rosa Menkman’s Glitch Studies Manifesto, which was: “Acknowledge that although the constant search for complete transparency brings newer, ‘better’ media, every one of these improved techniques will always possess their own inherent fingerprints of imperfection.” I shortened it to: “even 'perfect’ media still retains its unique imperfections". We had to interpret this sentence as a paper-prototype of a screen-based interactive media work. This means we only needed to make the paper-prototype, and not the coded digital work. I saw everyone else’s projects and prototypes that day, and it was really interesting seeing how everyone else interpreted their sentence, and how they executed their prototypes. I saw that some people kept it simple and short because it would be easier to code for project 2, and others who made their prototype more elaborate and complex. </p>
            <h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>
            <p>Although I think my paper prototype was definitely too complex to code by myself, I thought this was a really good opportunity to experiment so I could get as much feedback as I could after I submitted it. This project was really helpful in this way, and I got a lot of insight on what I should for my next assignment project, which is to actually code a website (that may or may be completely different to the paper prototype we made). </p>
