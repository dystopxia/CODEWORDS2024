            <h1>Week 4</h1>
            <h3>Tuesday, 13th August</h3>
            
            <h2>Class Activities:</h2>
            <p>In this week’s class, we went through reading machines, and some net artists like <a href="https://angeloplessas.com/" target="_blank">Angelo Plessas</a> and <a href="https://www.newrafael.com/internet/" target="_blank"> Rafaël Rozendaal</a>’s works. It was really interesting seeing how they experimented with so many different ways to code. Their works are very funky, and some don't seem to make sense at first, but when we got to explore the sites, I realised they were just really expressive and artistic. We also did an exercise where we think of an object and try to get someone else to draw it while we provide written instructions on how to draw it. I chose to describe a lemon that has been cut in half (the inside of it with segments and seeds). It was really challenging to describe, but the person who got my instructions was able to draw it correctly. This got us to think about how important it is to be clear so an idea can be translated the way we intend for it to be translated. Towards the end of the morning class, we were asked to draw a simple portrait of ourselves using basic shapes so we should recreate them in p5.js later. In the PM class, we created some new experimental sites, following along with our tutor’s code. Later on, we began to code our portraits. At first, I was really confused how I could arrange the shapes where I wanted them to be. I had to figure it out in my own time and played around with the positioning of the ovals to create the bangs and pigtails. This task was rewarding for me, because we had to try and code it ourselves.</p>

            <h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>
            <p>Working on my self-portrait made me more comfortable with arranging shapes and gave me confidence in using p5.js for more artistic projects. However, I’m still curious about how to incorporate more complex interactivity into my projects, especially in ways that feel intuitive and not forced.</p>
