            <h3>Tuesday, 20th August</h3>
            
            <h2>Class Activities:</h2>
            <p>This week, I learned how to incorporate random colour generation and image handling into my coding projects. The introduction of the random RGB function was really cool because we could get really creative with our designs. This weekâ€™s class significantly impacted my understanding of coding, especially regarding colour and image manipulation. After the session, I felt like I was more confident in using randomization to create lively and expressive designs. The challenge of implementing new techniques was rewarding, and I appreciated seeing how my peers approached similar tasks.</p>
            
            <h2>Coding Techniques:</h2>
            <p>Learning to preload and display images is essential for integrating visual media into my projects. This process made it clear how to incorporate personal images into my sketches, making my work more personal and engaging.</p>
