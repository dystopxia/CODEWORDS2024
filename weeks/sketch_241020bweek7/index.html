            <h1>Week 7</h1>
            <h3>Tuesday, 10th September</h3>
            
            <h2>Class Activities:</h2>
            <p>This weekâ€™s class was packed with practical coding exercises. We focused on creating custom cursors, hover effects, loading images, and using the preload() function. We also experimented with making images function as cursors and created multiple spawn buttons with dynamic placement on the screen. I gained deeper insights into using p5.js for interactive design. By learning how to create custom cursors and multiple buttons, I expanded my understanding of interactivity in web design. I think I should experiment more with these codes to build more engaging, user-interactive websites. It also prepares me for my next project, because one of my ideas involves buttons and hover effects. This lesson reinforced the concept of randomness and interaction that we've been building on throughout the course.</p>
            <h2>Coding Techniques:</h2>
            <p>Image as Cursor in p5.js: By using the code image(pic, mouseX, mouseY, 100, 100);, we can replace the default mouse pointer with a custom image.
            <p>Spawning Multiple Buttons: Generating buttons with random positions is a cool way to add interactivity. It introduces randomization in placement, making each instance different and I could definitely try and incorporate this into my next project.</p>
