            <h1>Week 3</h1>
            <h3>Tuesday, 8th August</h3>
            
            <h2>Class Activities:</h2>
            <p>This week, we focused on GitHub, discussing its uses and applications, such as managing coding projects, collaborating with others, and publishing work online without server fees. We participated in a "Crazy 8s" exercise, where we generated eight ideas in one minute based on a chosen phrase. I selected "well, hello there," and sketched different concepts on A4 paper. Another exercise involved creating concrete poetry, where we explored the form and then generated ideas using the Crazy 8s method again. My sentence was "error. source code malfunction," which led to several creative ideas. We also did a group activity - making a vintage video game paper prototype. This was a very fun and helpful activity; we got to work with other people and assigned different roles for everyone. Our group made a mario game. This exercise really got us to consider how we could translate the actual game into instructions and such. </p>
            <h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>
            <p>Both the Crazy 8s exercise and the game prototype development illustrated the iterative nature of design. I learned that initial ideas can evolve and improve through feedback and collaboration, which is a key principle in both coding and design thinking. The vintage video game task also emphasized the importance of collaboration. I learned how to assign roles effectively and leverage each team member's strengths to achieve a common goal, enhancing my teamwork skills.<p/>
            <h2>Glossary of New Terms:</h2>
            <p><strong>Concrete Poetry:</strong> A form of poetry where the visual arrangement of words contributes to the overall meaning.
