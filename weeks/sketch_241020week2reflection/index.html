            <h1>Week 2</h1>
            <h3>Tuesday, 30th July</h3>
            
            <h2>Class Activities:</h2>
            <p>In our first week’s class, we were introduced to the course outline and objectives. We downloaded the required software, created a GitHub account, and made our first repository. We were encouraged to try out Visual Studio Code and coded our first "Hello World" website. The session included hands-on activities where we set up a basic HTML page, imported and centered an image, and applied CSS styles. This week’s lesson significantly enhanced my understanding of web development fundamentals. Creating a basic webpage with visual elements was rewarding and encouraged my interest in further exploring CSS for design. I still have questions about best practices for responsive design and how to optimize images for the web.</p>

            <h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>
            <p>This week, I learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, including how to structure a web page and apply styles. We created a basic webpage with an image and text, enhancing my understanding of how HTML elements work together. This builds on my previous knowledge of coding logic, but introduces the specifics of web development.</p>

            <h2>Glossary of New Terms:</h2>
            <p><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong> The standard markup language used to create web pages. <br>
            <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> A stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML.</p>

            <h2>Coding Techniques:</h2>
            <p>This basic structure is essential for any HTML document and provides a foundation for further web development.</p>
