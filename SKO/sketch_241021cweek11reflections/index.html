            <h2>Class Activities:</h2>
            <p>I wasn’t able to attend class this week due to being sick, but I spoke with my friends, and they told me that the class continued to focus on our SKO websites and Project 2 website designs. Even though I missed the in-class activities, I kept working on my SKO and Project 2 at home. I was able to apply the knowledge I gained in previous weeks to both of my projects. Playing around with different imported fonts and arranging and manipulating them has been a bit of a learning curve, because I originally used a png of my text. But I want to import actual text, so I’m excited to see how I’ll improve the interactivity and design of my final project.</p>
            <h2>Progress on Major Project 2:</h2>
            <p>As for Project 2, I continued to experiment with using multiple canvases in p5.js, which I learned last week, and have been exploring how to import different fonts into the sketch. Initially, I had used a PNG image of the text for my design, but I’ve now shifted my focus to coding the text directly by importing fonts. This will give me more flexibility to manipulate the text and create the effects I want with the spotlight reveal concept.</p>
            <h2>Progress on SKO:</h2>
            <p>For my SKO, I’ve been building all the webpages and coding using HTML in Processing. I’m still working on the design and functionality of the page but I’m making steady progress. The coding is a challenge, but I plan to keep refining the layout and structure until I’m satisfied with how the website works and looks.</p>
