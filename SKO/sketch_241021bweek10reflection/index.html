            <h1>Week 10</h1>
            <h3>Tuesday, 1st October</h3>
            
            <h2>Class Activities:</h2>
            <p>One of the key topics we covered this week was the ‘multiple canvas’ feature in p5.js, which was particularly relevant to my final project concept. I’m planning to use two canvases: a bottom layer with my text - "perfect media still retains its imperfections" - and a top layer with a spotlight cursor. The text will be hidden under the top layer, and when you hover over the screen, the spotlight will reveal the text. We used an example sketch that demonstrated the use of erase() and createGraphics() to manage multiple layers and create this reveal effect. This example showed us how to set up two canvases and apply the spotlight functionality to the top layer.</p>
            <h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>
            <p>The spotlight cursor effect, achieved through erase(), gave me insight into how I can manipulate visibility in a more dynamic way. This lesson had a direct impact on my final project, as I was able to immediately apply what we learned about multiple canvases. The spotlight effect aligns perfectly with my concept. The feedback I received in class was also really helpful in refining my approach. I’m excited to continue working on my project and see how I can further enhance the design.</p>
