            <h1>Week 9</h1>
            <h3>Tuesday, 24th September</h3>
            
            <h2>Class Activities:</h2>
            <p>This week, we reviewed the coding concepts from last week and reached a milestone in our SKO work. The class was also very hands-on, focusing on practical coding tasks in p5.js. We created “wriggly letters” using a custom class and implemented movement and size changes to the letters with mouse interactions. The code structure involved an array to hold the wiggly letters, and for each mouse press, a new letter was added at the cursor's position. I thought the wriggling effect was really cool and had a lot of potential to be used into future projects. The basic setup included functions for setting up the canvas, drawing the letters, and handling user interactions. We briefly explored a new technique for converting text to points. Though we ran out of time to delve deeply into it, I found the concept fascinating. This method involves tracing the text with points, which can then be manipulated for various visual effects.</p>
            <h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>
            <p>The exploration of converting text to points introduced me to a new way of visualizing typography, which aligns with my interests in both coding and design. It built upon my previous experiences with coding and opened up new avenues for experimentation in my projects. If I had a question, it would be how can I optimize the performance of sketches that involve numerous animated elements? Or, are there advanced techniques for manipulating point data to create more intricate visual effects?</p>
